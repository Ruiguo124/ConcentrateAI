## Inspiration
More and more people get diagnosed with ADHD every year which puts them on a disadvantage on the educational field, and with many students cramming for the upcoming finals, we decided to create a web app which helps with studying.

## What it does
It detects when the user starts to fall asleep/doze off and outputs audio and light waves and to wake him up. There is also a stopwatch which records how long the user has been studying for.

We designed our website using a minimalist design to reduce distractions with shades of blue which further promotes concentration.

## How we built it
We used HTML5 and JavaScript to create the web app and the backend was done using Tensorflow and Opencv. We found a database of pictures with people blinking and used it to train our Multi Layered(3) Convolutional Neural Network for 3 epochs which gets us a model with and accuracy of 70%.
